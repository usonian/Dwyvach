#Dwyvach

Dwyvach is a set of PHP classes for building and rendering weaving drafts.

I am a weaving novice, so if I am abusing weaving terminology or missing an
obvious feature, please let me know.

\([.wif file](http://www.mhsoft.com/wif/wif.html) import/export might happen eventually, but it might not.\)

Dwyvach is named for the weaver of the same name in Lloyd Alexander's *Taran Wanderer*.

##Requirements

* The [ColorChip class](https://github.com/usonian/ColorChip/archives/1.1) to represent thread colors.
* The PHP [GD](http://php.net/gd) extension if you plan to use the render() method.
